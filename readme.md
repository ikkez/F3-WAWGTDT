## F3-WAWGTDT
(What are we going to do today?)-App

This is a little demo application based on [PHP Fat-Free Framework](https://github.com/bcosca/fatfree) v3.2.

It utilizes namespaces, uses a simple MVC pattern and was built with progressive enhancement and therefore works with pretty nice AJAX calls as well as with javascript disabled and usual requests.

I hope this can help you to get familiar with this nice framework.
